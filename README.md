## Prompt
Write an application that allows two people, on different computers,
to play a game of tic-tac-toe together.

This prompt is intentionally vague on details. You should use this time
to ask clarifying questions, ensure you understand the scope of the work,
and propose a high-level solution to the problem.

## Process
* Push your commits to this repository as you make progress.
* Please don't take more than ~3 hours total over the next few days.
* We have opened up a Slack channel for you to ask questions and get clarification - use it liberally!
* Once you're done (we typically allot 5 business days), we'll meet to discuss your work.
* Incomplete solutions are perfectly OK. If there are features you didn't have time to implement, simply document what they are and how you would have implemented them.

## Evaulation Criteria
* Code quality
* Communication
* Documentation

## Next steps
That's it. Good luck, and have fun!
